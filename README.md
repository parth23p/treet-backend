# treet-backend

This backend is hosted at : https://treet-backend.herokuapp.com/
published postment documentation link: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17274040/UyrAGxsX

Open your postman desktop application set HTTP method as GET and paste the URL : https://treet-backend.herokuapp.com/api/posts?tags=tech,health,history,science,culture,politics&sortBy=id&direction=desc in click send button.

You will get the response as per the response shown in postman documentation.

Otherwise you can run the project on local machine by running command npm install and then running npm start command.

The backend server will start then and you can make a get request via postman to the URL
http://localhost:3000/api/posts?tags=tech,health&sortBy=reads&direction=asc and wait for the response data.

I have manually tested the API endpoint fro different inputs and they are working as per the requirement. I searched for Jest for testing but felt that it will require some time for me to learn about it properly.

Another thing is that I have done this project in more than one sittings due to college work so the total time span for this project may be larger.
